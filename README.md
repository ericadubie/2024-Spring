## I am Erica Dubie and am currently a senior, majoring in Computer Science, and have
actually completed all required Computer Science courses for the major. I wanted to take this
class when I had a lighter semester so I could really delve into it and put a lot of time and effort
into the course. I completed a Digital Technology internship for GE Vernova over the summer
and fall of 2023 working in predictive analytics and utilizing python libraries like pandas and
numpy to work with and manipulate data. As far as personal projects, I completed the Software
Engineering course here where I worked within a group to build a Point of Sale System for a
mock gym. This project used HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. On my own time, I built a Rain
Weather Alert System using Python, a weather API, HTML/CSS, and AWS lambda functions.
This project took a deviceâ€™s IP address, checked the chance of rain in that location through the
weather API and sent an email notification to the user if there was a chance of rain and
reminded them to bring an umbrella. It was checked hourly using AWS lambda functions to run
the program on the hour.
## In this web development class, I'm excited to learn about full stack development with
NodeJS and Vue. I plan to use these skills to build responsive web applications, focusing on
technologies like Git, Express, and asynchronous programming. This experience will be key for
my career, helping me keep up with the latest industry demands. I'm particularly eager to work
on the two mobile-first web apps we'll be developing, as this will not only enhance my portfolio
but also solidify my understanding of these technologies. This course is a great opportunity for
me to become a versatile developer!
